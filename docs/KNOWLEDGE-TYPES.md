# Knowledge Types — canonical reference

> The atomic-knowledge prefix taxonomy GKS recognises. Every `.md` file
> under `gks/` should have a frontmatter `id: TYPE--SLUG` whose `TYPE`
> appears in this document. ADR-012 records why this list exists.

This is the **reference** — when you ask "where does this concept go?"
the answer is here. Templates for each prefix live in
[`examples/atom-templates/`](../examples/atom-templates/).

## Cluster 1 — Implementation Flow

Phase-aligned with the build pipeline (P0 → P6). When in doubt, this is
where most contributions go.

### `IDEA--` · raw spark
- **Use for:** the original prompt / one-line idea before any analysis.
- **Don't use for:** anything that's been triaged into a concept — promote to `CONCEPT--`.
- **Phase:** P0.
- **Lifecycle:** typically short-lived; promoted into `CONCEPT--` within days.

### `CONCEPT--` · human-readable requirement / vision
- **Use for:** PRDs, journeys, roadmaps, ROI analyses written for human review.
- **Don't use for:** technical specifications — those are ADRs / FEATs / ALGOs / blueprints.
- **Phase:** P1.
- **Examples:** `CONCEPT--PRD.md`, `CONCEPT--ROADMAP.md`, `CONCEPT--JOURNEY-CHECKOUT.md`.

### `ADR--` · architecture decision record
- **Use for:** every load-bearing technical or organisational decision (and its alternatives).
- **Don't use for:** *what* the system does (FEAT) or *how* it computes things (ALGO).
- **Phase:** P2.
- **Lifecycle:** set-once, mostly stable; superseded by another ADR if revisited.
- **Status values:** `proposed` / `accepted` / `superseded` / `rejected`.

### `MOD--` · module manifest
- **Use for:** declaring a module's scope, public API, and ownership boundary.
- **Don't use for:** the code itself (P5 `src/`).
- **Phase:** P2.

### `FEAT--` · feature spec
- **Use for:** user-facing system behaviour ("when user clicks X, system Y").
- **Don't use for:** agent capabilities — those are `SKILL--`.
- **Phase:** P2.

### `ALGO--` · algorithm
- **Use for:** computational steps, scoring formulas, ranking logic.
- **Don't use for:** API contracts (use `API--`) or features (use `FEAT--`).
- **Phase:** P2.

### `FLOW--` · data / UI flow
- **Use for:** data movement diagrams, UI navigation flows, sequence-style flows.
- **Don't use for:** call graphs (let GitNexus / similar handle that — see ADR-009).
- **Phase:** P2.
- **Tip:** also valid as `.canvas` files for Obsidian Canvas diagrams.

### `ENTITY--` · data schema
- **Use for:** data model / DB schema definitions.
- **Don't use for:** API request/response shapes (use `ENDPOINT--`).
- **Phase:** P2.

### `API--` · OpenAPI master hub
- **Use for:** the single canonical OpenAPI document referencing all endpoints.
- **Don't use for:** individual endpoints — those split into `ENDPOINT--`.
- **Phase:** P2.

### `ENDPOINT--` · one API path / method
- **Use for:** a single HTTP method × path's contract (request, response, errors).
- **Don't use for:** the cross-cutting auth/middleware (use `ENTRYPOINT--`).
- **Phase:** P2.

### `ENTRYPOINT--` · auth / middleware / access logic
- **Use for:** how requests enter the system (auth gates, rate limits, tenant resolution).
- **Don't use for:** business logic that runs after the entrypoint (use `FEAT--` / `ALGO--`).
- **Phase:** P2.

### `PARAMS--` · constants / business config
- **Use for:** business-meaningful numbers, threshold lists, configuration tables.
- **Don't use for:** infra constants (Postgres pool size etc.) — those live in `ops/` configs.
- **Phase:** P2.

### `FRAME--` · code standards / framework rules
- **Use for:** "all DB calls go through repositories", "components ≤ 500 LOC", lint policy.
- **Don't use for:** runtime behavioural constraints — those are `GUARDRAIL--`.
- **Phase:** P2.

### `BLUEPRINT--` · implementation plan
- **Use for:** the YAML plan that microtask codegen consumes.
- **Don't use for:** prose specs — those are `FEAT--`.
- **Phase:** P3.
- **Required fields:** `metadata`, `architectural_pattern`, `data_logic`, `geography`, `api_contracts`, `verification_plan`.

### `POC--` · time-boxed hypothesis-test atom
- **Use for:** a falsifiable experiment with a deadline — proving (or
  disproving) an assumption before it locks in as `ADR--` / `BLUEPRINT--`.
- **Don't use for:** the resulting decision (use `ADR--`) or the
  verification *result* of an already-decided plan (use `AUDIT--`).
- **Phase:** P1 (between `CONCEPT--` and `BLUEPRINT--`).
- **Tier:** **light** — direct write OK; schema-validated; lifecycle-enforced.
- **Status values:** `open` → `running` → terminal: `validated` /
  `invalidated` / `abandoned`.
- **Required fields:** `hypothesis` (one paragraph, falsifiable),
  `acceptance_criteria` (≥1 measurable check), `time_box.deadline`
  (ISO timestamp).
- **Crosslinks:** `derives_from: [CONCEPT--…]`, `produces:
  [BLUEPRINT--…, AUDIT--…]`, `feeds_into: [ADR--…]` (filled at close).
- **Overdue policy:** after `time_box.deadline` with non-terminal status,
  the pre-commit hook blocks commits touching `linked_symbols` paths
  (mirrors `HOTFIX--` 48 h window — ADR-014). See
  `ADR--ADD-POC-PREFIX` for full lifecycle rationale.

### Microtasks (`T*.task.yaml`) — **not atoms**
- **Why:** task state churns hourly (assigned / in-progress / blocked /
  done), accumulates comments, and has zero retrieval value once shipped.
  Atoms are durable knowledge with settling time; tasks are
  execution state that belongs at the orchestrator layer (ADR-015).
- **Where they live:** `.brain/<ns>/tasks/<slug>/T<n>_<name>.task.yaml`
  for self-hosted projects, `msp/projects/<id>/tasks/` for MSP-layered
  projects, or an external tracker (Linear/Jira/Asana) keyed off
  `BLUEPRINT.geography`.
- **Integration with GKS:** `BLUEPRINT--` declares the *shape* of the
  work (file paths, acceptance criteria, architectural pattern);
  `AUDIT--` records the *outcome* once the task closes. Both are
  durable. Live status in between is the orchestrator's job — see
  `docs/MSP_RELATIONSHIP.md` for the contract.

### `AUDIT--` · test results / quality report
- **Use for:** sign-off documents recording verification outcomes.
- **Don't use for:** the *plan* (that's `BLUEPRINT.verification_plan`); only the *result*.
- **Phase:** P6.

## Cluster 2 — Agent Governance

These prefixes were missing from the original taxonomy; they exist
because every agentic project hits them within weeks. See ADR-012 for
rationale.

### `SKILL--` · agent capability
- **Use for:** an action / tool the agent has been given access to.
- **Don't use for:** user-facing behaviour (use `FEAT--`) or modules (use `MOD--`).
- **Distinguishing question:** *who triggers it?* → if the agent triggers it from context, it's a SKILL.
- **Examples:** `SKILL--CHECK-DRIFT`, `SKILL--PROPOSE-INBOUND`, `SKILL--SUMMARISE-SESSION`.

### `PROTOCOL--` · interaction contract
- **Use for:** handshake / message-format contracts between agents or between agent and system (MCP, agent-to-agent).
- **Don't use for:** HTTP API endpoint contracts — those are `ENDPOINT--`.
- **Distinguishing question:** *is this a multi-step interaction?* → if yes, PROTOCOL; if request/response single-shot, ENDPOINT.

### `GUARDRAIL--` · enforced behavioural policy
- **Use for:** runtime-enforced constraint on agent / tool behaviour ("never call X without Y").
- **Don't use for:** policy-by-decision (that's `ADR--`) or operational policy (that's `POLICY--`).
- **Distinguishing question:** *is it enforced at every call?* → if yes, GUARDRAIL.

### `POLICY--` · operational policy
- **Use for:** access policies (RBAC), data retention, rate limits.
- **Don't use for:** behavioural constraints during a single agent action — those are `GUARDRAIL--`.
- **Distinguishing question:** *does it govern config / access at the system level?* → POLICY.

### `PERSONA--` · agent identity
- **Use for:** the agent's role, voice, base system prompt seed.
- **Don't use for:** the agent's tools — those are `SKILL--`.

## Cluster 3 — Requirements Engineering

`CONCEPT--REQ.md` was previously the umbrella; that conflated
verification approaches. Split per ADR-012.

### `REQ--` · umbrella requirement
- **Use for:** cross-cutting requirements that span FR + NFR.
- **Optional:** projects that only have FR/NFR can skip the umbrella.

### `FR--` · functional requirement
- **Use for:** "system shall do X" — verifiable by unit / E2E.
- **Don't use for:** "system shall be fast / available / scalable" — those are `NFR--`.

### `NFR--` · non-functional requirement
- **Use for:** performance, scalability, security, availability, observability targets.
- **Verification:** load test / pen test / chaos test / availability monitoring.
- **Examples:** `NFR--P99-LATENCY-200MS`, `NFR--AVAILABILITY-99-9`.

### `CONSTRAINT--` · hard external constraint
- **Use for:** regulatory (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI), contractual, compliance.
- **Don't use for:** internally-chosen targets — those are `NFR--` or `POLICY--`.

## Cluster 4 — Ops Governance

The atomic surface of operations. Distinct from `MSP-INC-` etc., which
are process-tracking event logs.

### `INC--` · incident post-mortem
- **Use for:** distilled lesson from a production incident.
- **Don't use for:** the raw event log — that's `MSP-INC-` in process tracking.
- **Lifecycle:** written after triage; mostly stable thereafter.

### `HOTFIX--` · hotfix escape-hatch atom
- **Use for:** the 48-hour backfill window opened when prod is down and a fix
  ships before P1–P3 atoms exist (master-spec §6.4, ADR-014).
- **Don't use for:** the post-mortem itself — that's `INC--`.
- **Tier:** light — written automatically by `gks hotfix open` or the
  pre-commit hook when a `HOTFIX` tag is detected.
- **Required:** `valid_to` (= commit-time + 48 h) and `meta.commit_sha`.
- **Closure rule:** backfill atoms (`CONCEPT--`, `ADR--`, `BLUEPRINT--`) must
  declare `crosslinks.resolves: [HOTFIX--<sha>]`. After `valid_to`, the
  pre-commit hook blocks any commit on the affected files until that resolution
  is in place.

### `ISSUE--` · live issue tracker
- **Use for:** open problems / bugs / improvement requests — replaces Linear/Jira.
- **Don't use for:** decisions (use `ADR--`) or features (use `FEAT--`).
- **Lifecycle:** **mutates frequently** — status changes, comments, reassignments. Lives in the
  light-governance tier (`gks/issues/`); schema-validated but doesn't require human-review for
  routine operations. See ADR-012.
- **Required frontmatter:** `id`, `phase`, `type: issue`, `status` (open / triaged /
  in_progress / blocked / closed / wontfix), `priority` (low / medium / high / urgent),
  `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **Recommended:** `assignee`, `reporter`, `labels`, `crosslinks.related_incidents`,
  `crosslinks.resolved_by`, `crosslinks.duplicates_of`, `crosslinks.blocks`.
- **Body convention:** `## Description`, `## Reproduction` (when applicable),
  `## Discussion` (append-only chronological), `## Resolution` (filled at close).

### `RISK--` · identified risk + mitigation
- **Use for:** "X could go wrong because Y" *before* it actually does.
- **Don't use for:** post-incident learning — that's `INC--`.

### `RUNBOOK--` · operational response guide
- **Use for:** "if you see X, do Y" — for on-call humans / agents.
- **Don't use for:** decisions (`ADR--`) or risk identification (`RISK--`).

### `SLO--` · service-level objective
- **Use for:** measurable availability / latency / error-rate targets + alert thresholds.
- **Don't use for:** non-measurable goals — those are `CONCEPT--` or `NFR--`.

## Memory-system extras

GKS code (`src/memory/types.ts` `AtomicType`) recognises three
additional types that are typically auto-generated by the Consolidator
rather than human-authored:

### `INSIGHT--` · session-derived observation
- Auto-extracted by `reflect()` from session traces — represents
  something noticed during a conversation that's worth retaining.

### `FACT--` · retain-derived fact
- Stored via `retain()` when the LLM asserts a discrete factual claim
  worth bi-temporal versioning.

### `RULE--` · derived behavioural rule
- A heuristic / pattern derived from multiple observations. Often
  promoted later into a formal `GUARDRAIL--` or `POLICY--` after review.

## Process tracking IDs (not atomic knowledge)

These have `MSP-` prefix and live in process-tracking storage, not in
`gks/`. Listed here for completeness — see FRAMEWORK_MASTER_SPEC §11.

| Prefix | Role |
|---|---|
| `MSP-SESS-` | Session ID |
| `MSP-IMP-` | Implementation Plan |
| `MSP-TSK-` | Task log |
| `MSP-ACT-` | Action log (per turn) |
| `MSP-WKT-` | Walkthrough (sign-off bundle) |
| `MSP-INC-` | Incident event (raw, distinct from `INC--` post-mortem) |
| `MSP-REV-` | Review |
| `MSP-FBK-` | Feedback |
| `MSP-USR-` | User identity |
| `MSP-AGT-` | Agent identity |
